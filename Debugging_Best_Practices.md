### Debugging Best Practices


### Check the error!
You and your partner may know exactly where your code finally broke. If you're familiar with the error, follow solution patterns you already know! If you're not, copy/paste the error into Google to search.

### Write down what you expect the code to be doing right now.
What feature are you working on? What should it be doing when it works?

### Compare this to what your code is actually doing.
"I expect my code to do X, but instead it's doing Y."

### Step through your code to find the last place it's working as you expect / the first place it stops doing the thing you expect. 
You and your partner have now identified what your code is doing that is different from you want it to do, and where it's doing the unexpected thing! If you don't understand the surrounding code, look it up! This is where Google and Stack Overflow come in to help you search.

### Look for a solution. 
Investigate ways to get to the output you want. 
Don’t be afraid to break things. 
Try as many approaches as possible. 
Look for solutions online. 
Keeping the ultimate goal of your code work in mind (“What is the output I want?”), revisit what you and your partner
