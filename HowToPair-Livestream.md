# How To Pair Remotely


## Pairing Dynamics

As per the [Pair-Programming-Reference-Guide](https://github.com/kmcelveen/PrepPlus-Student-Wiki/blob/master/Pair-Programming-Reference-Guide.md) and the [Pair Programming](http://slides.com/telegraphprep/pair-programming/#/) slides, we seriously advocate this pattern. It helps us become effective engineers and vastly improves communication. Pairing fosters better collaboration and we all know that products are built by teams therefore embracing effective collaboration is vital. 

The Telegraph Prep+ team would like livestreamers to have the same experience that onsite students have and would love to see livestreamers collaborate just as much as onsite students. We have adopted a new way to support livestream collaboration by utilizing a tool name Screen Hero. Screen Hero is a great screensharing tool that supports audio and messaging which are all the tools you need to pair program with other students in the class. Below we will walk you through how to setup Screen Hero on your machine:




* [Navigate to DropBox here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/kqwmw2sfhao7yn9/AABLAcx1se3MDMRc6LPXMlgHa?dl=0) to download the Screen Hero application. There are two download files in the folder, one for Mac users (Screenhero.dmg) and one for Windows users (Screenhero-Lastest-setup.exe). Once you download the application, go ahead and install the application. For Mac users, you will get a box that pops up asking you to drag the app into the application folder.

* Once you are signed in, add your pair by clicking on the person icon in the top right corner. You will be prompted to enter your pair's email address. Your pair will receive a notification that you would like to add them to your contact list and once your pair accepts then you will see your pair in your contact list. You now have the option to do an audio call, share your screen or chat.

> You can follow the instructions above to add instructors and TA's to your contact list

* To share your screen with your pair, just hover over your pair's name in the contact list and click on the monitor icon then click on which screen you would like to share (if you have multiple monitors). The green dot next to your pair's name will turn red which means your screen share session is now active.

* Screen Hero allows you to add more people to the screen share session as well. Find the individual you would like to add to the screen share session, hover over their name and click on the ```+``` icon. 

> Use these directions in the case that you would like to receive video assistance from a TA.
