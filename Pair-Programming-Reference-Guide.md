# Pair Programming Reference Guide for Prep+ Students

You will be pair programming to complete most of the exercises and projects in this course. In addition to this reference guide, you can review the Pair Programming slides [here](http://slides.com/telegraphprep/pair-programming/).

## Pair Programming Workflow

We pair program to become more effective engineers.

- Pair programming lets us practice communication skills (e.g., empathy, expression, listening). You practice expressing your ideas using programming terminology, and you also practice listening/understanding another person's thought process.

- Pair programming lets us collaborate with other engineers to bring more ideas to the table and help catch potential bugs.

## How do we pair program?

We pair program using driver/navigator dynamics.
- The navigator's role:  
	\- computer is closed  
	\- totally hands off  
	\- expresses what to do and how, using plain English (e.g., "iterate through the array" NOT "write for-var-i-equals-zero-semi-colon" etc.)

- The driver's role:  
	\- work from this computer  
	\- listens for direction from navigator  
	\- understand the plan and ask questions when confused  
	\- write pseudocode and actual code  

- Switch roles every 20 minutes.

- Refer to the gitWorkflow for pair programming document [here](https://github.com/TelegraphPrep/PrepPlus-Wiki/blob/master/gitWorkflow.md).

- Remember to make pair programming a positive experience and to spend time getting on the same page.

- If you are the more experienced (senior) person in your pair,  
	\- practice communicating clearly  
	\- solidify your technical skills  
	\- practice teaching and empathy  

- If you are the less experienced (junior) person in your pair,  
	\- be curious and ask questions  
	\- express when you don't understand something  
	\- solidify your technical skills  

## Useful tips

- check in with one another regularly
- provide feedback to improve the experience
- if there's a conflict, talk to an instructor or TA
- Avoid driving and navigating at the same time
- Be flexible with your own ideas
- Don't be offensive, rude, or condescending
