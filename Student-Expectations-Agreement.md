#Student Expectations for Telegraph Prep+

Telegraph Prep+ is a course for **serious** future engineers who'd like to master JavaScript and Software Engineering fundamentals. With that being said, we want to set some guidelines for students who are interested in being a part of our community. 

The guidelines below outline what we expect from students while they attend TGP+. They are not arbitrary, but built from what we've seen from the most successful students, and cohorts. A strong community builds strong engineers, and that's what we live to uphold at TGP+. If you feel you can not follow these guidelines, or have any questions, reach out to us at prep@telegraphacademy.com and we will figure out a way to accomodate you.

The [expectations lecture](http://slides.com/telegraphprep/expectations#/) given on Week 1 Day 2 reiterates these guidelines.

###Guidelines: 

**Be on time:** We value punctuality. If you show up after 6:25pm, you're late. â€‹

**Be present:** Our schedule is highly condensed. Put your phone away, and keep conversations technical.

**Be respectful and professional:** It's important that we like each other and are taking this education seriously.

**Have a good attitude:** When you are frustrated, take a break. If you have feedback, give it constructively.

**Guest Policy:** No guests during the week. Sunday Study sessions are the best time.

**Be open and willing:** Trust us. These methods have worked for a lot of successful people. Let yourself take direction and you will succeed.

**The Space:** This is our coding sanctuary. Take care of it, and it will take care of you.

###Attendance Policy:

Missing 2 full days = not okay. If we notice your attendance slipping warn you. If the behavior continues we will ask you to
leave the course. 

Let us know **48 hours ahead of time** if you're going to miss class, or it's considered an unexcused absence.
Let us know **12 hours ahead of time** if you're going to be late, or it's considered a tardy.

You can message one of your instructors on the TGP+ Slack, or email us at prep@telegraphacademy.com

3 Tardies = 1 unexcused absence.
 
2 unexcused absences = removal from the course.
